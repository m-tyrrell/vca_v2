    ------------
    file_name: filename, in case of streamlit application use 
    st.session_state['filename']
    file_path: filepath, in case of streamlit application use st.session_state['filepath']
    split_by: document splitting strategy either as word or sentence
    split_length: when synthetically creating the paragrpahs from document,
                    it defines the length of paragraph.
    split_respect_sentence_boundary: Used when using 'word' strategy for 
    splititng of text.
    split_overlap: Number of words or sentences that overlap when creating
        the paragraphs. This is done as one sentence or 'some words' make sense
        when  read in together with others. Therefore the overlap is used.
    remove_punc: to remove all Punctuation including ',' and '.' or not
    Return
    --------------
    List[Document]: When preprocessing pipeline is run, the output dictionary 
    has four objects. For the Haysatck implementation of SDG classification we, 
    need to use the List of Haystack Document, which can be fetched by 
    key = 'documents' on output.
